# Version Control / Change Log

Use semantic versioning (X.Y.Z):  
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
1. MAJOR version release with incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version releasing adding functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. PATCH version releasing backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format, e.g.. "2.6.0-alpha"

ALL builds start at __version 0.1.0__  
Initial production release = __1.0.0__
